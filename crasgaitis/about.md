### About
Hi, I'm Catherine Rasgaitis! I'm studying Computer Science at UW. 

Todos:
* EDA ✔️
* filter and remove base quality features ✔️
* different num nucleotides ✔️
* benchmark basic lstm / rnn with eval ✔️
* try and look at weights/feature importance ✔️
* try all combinations of nucleotide window size 
* play around with BAM (+ maybe do visuals with that cuz it's cool lol)
* add early stopping
* lstm with h param search and more complex architecture
* eval
